LivingSlides
============

LivingSlides is an authoring tool that offers the user the posibility to have interactive content. This interactive content will change according to the user's wishes.

LivingSlides was created with teaching and classrooms in mind. Often, when a student has a question and the teacher feels the student will understand better with the aid of sketches, the teacher then switches from a multimedia presentation to a blackboard. What if the teacher could make all those drawings available in their presentation?
